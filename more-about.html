          More About my Retro Video Game Hobby
        </h1>
        <p>
          "What are retro video games? Retro gaming, also known as old school
          gaming, classic gaming and sometimes vintage gaming is the playing of
          older generation consoles, computers, handheld games, and arcade games
          in the present." <br />
          <br />
          Most of my favorite retro video games come from the Nintendo console
          line, such as the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), SNES (Super
          NES), and GBA (Game Boy Advance). As for which games I play, the Mario
          series, Megaman series, Kirby series, and Intelligent Systems games
          such as Blazing Blade and Advance Wars are my main go-to games. On my
          home computer I have a whole bunch of emulators and awesome games to
          play on them. (I'm currently working on Super Mario RPG: Legend of the
          Seven Stars. Give it a try!)
