          More About my Retro Video Game Hobby
        </h1>
        <p>
          "What are retro video games? Retro gaming, also known as old school
          gaming, classic gaming and sometimes vintage gaming is the playing of
          older generation consoles, computers, handheld games, and arcade games
          in the present." <br />
          <br />
          Most of my favorite retro video games come from the Nintendo console
          line, such as the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), SNES (Super
          NES), and GBA (Game Boy Advance). As for which games I play, the Mario
          series, Megaman series, Kirby series, and Intelligent Systems games
          such as Blazing Blade and Advance Wars are my main go-to games. On my
          home computer I have a whole bunch of emulators and awesome games to
          play on them. (I'm currently working on Super Mario RPG: Legend of the
          Seven Stars for the SNES. Give it a try!) <br />
          <br />
          A quick list of the emulators I use include: Mesen (for NES), snes9x
          (for SNES), and the Visual Boy Advance (for GBA). These are the first
          emulators I saw for download that had good ratings (though Mesen has
          some issues). These emulators are equipped with lots of tools
          including save states which I don't think should be used during
          gameplay, so I avoid using them where possible. (Though I've made an
          exception for Ninja Gaiden stage 6 boss deaths. That's just straight
          up evil.)
