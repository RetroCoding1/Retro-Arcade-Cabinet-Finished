        <p>
          This website is dedicated to showcasing my interest for retro video
          games. There are too many games and consoles that many people have
          already deserted for the newer modern age to count. But many of these
          games are still fun to play to this day, such as Super Mario World on
          the Super Nintendo Entertainment System or Fire Emblem on the Game Boy
          Advance, and I really enjoy them. I unfortunately don't have enough
          money or freedom to go out of my way and get all the old consoles plus
          all the games I enjoy playing on them for the true experience, so an
          emulator on my home computer and my trusty headphones will do for me.
          Happy browsing!
