          Arcade Machines
        </h1>
        <p>
          First off, what the heck even is an arcade machine? In wikipedia, it 
          says that An arcade game or coin-op game is a coin-operated entertainment 
          machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, 
          bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are presented as primarily 
          games of skill (examples: Pac-Man, Street Fighter, Donkey Kong) and include 
          arcade video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption 
          games or merchandisers. <br>
          Unfortunately, I was born a little too late to experience the
          greatness of getting to go to the arcade with friends. Now that more
          modern and advanced games are available on consoles and PC,
          coin-operated games are obsolete. <br /><br />
          The golden age of arcade machines was during the late 1970s through
          the 1980s, which was during my parent's teen years. <br /><br />
          In the past I have built an small-scale arcade machine and a game to
          be run on said machine. As a product I could try porting some of my
          homemade games coded in Scratch (such as Rebellion's End) and put them
          onto the machine.
