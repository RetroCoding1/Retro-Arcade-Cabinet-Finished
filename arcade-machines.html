          Arcade Machines
        </h1>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, I was born a little too late to experience the
          greatness of getting to go to the arcade with friends. Now that more
          modern and advanced games are available on consoles and PC,
          coin-operated games are obsolete. <br /><br />
          The golden age of arcade machines was during the late 1970s through
          the 1980s, which was during my parent's teen years. <br /><br />
          In the past I have built an small-scale arcade machine and a game to
          be run on said machine. As a product I could port some of my homemade
          games coded in Scratch (such as Rebellion's End) and put them onto the
          machine.
